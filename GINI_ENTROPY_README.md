## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered

### Gini Impurity
```
Gini = 1 - Σ(pi)²
```
- **Range**: 0 to 0.5 (binary classification)
- **Computation**: Fast (no logarithms)
- **Best for**: Balanced datasets, computational efficiency

### Entropy
```
Entropy = -Σ(pi × log₂(pi))
```
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (binary classification)
- **Computation**: Slower (logarithmic calculations)
- **Best for**: Imbalanced datasets, maximum sensitivity

## 📊 Visualizations Included

1. **Gini vs Entropy Curves**: Shows how both measures change with class probability
2. **Distribution Comparison**: Bar charts for different class distributions
3. **Information Gain Example**: Demonstrates how splits reduce impurity
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: How small changes affect each measure
5. **Decision Tree Comparison**: Side-by-side trees using different criteria

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Lecture

## 💡 Example Calculations

### Dataset: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
- **Classes**: 5 × Class 0, 5 × Class 1
- **Probabilities**: P(0) = 0.5, P(1) = 0.5

**Gini Calculation:**
```
Gini = 1 - (0.5² + 0.5²) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
```

**Entropy Calculation:**
```
Entropy = -(0.5×log₂(0.5) + 0.5×log₂(0.5)) = 1.0
```

## 🎯 When to Use Which?

| Scenario | Recommended | Reason |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Large datasets** | Gini | Faster computation |
| **Imbalanced classes** | Entropy | More sensitive to changes |
| **scikit-learn default** | Gini | Library default |
| **Information theory** | Entropy | Theoretical foundation |
| **Real-time applications** | Gini | Speed advantage |
