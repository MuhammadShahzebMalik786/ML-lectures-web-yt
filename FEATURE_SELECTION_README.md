## üîç Sample Output

The demo will show you:
```
Method          Features   Train Acc    Test Acc     Gap     
------------------------------------------------------------
Baseline        30         0.9874       0.9883       -0.0009 
Filter (F-test) 10         0.9648       0.9357       0.0292  
Wrapper (RFE)   10         0.9749       0.9181       0.0567  

üèÜ Best performing method: Baseline (Test Acc: 0.9883)
```

## üìã Implementation Details

### Filter Methods Implementation:
```python
# F-test
selector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=10)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)

# Mutual Information
selector_mi = SelectKBest(mutual_info_classif, k=10)
X_selected = selector_mi.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
```

### Wrapper Methods Implementation:
```python
# RFE
estimator = RandomForestClassifier()
selector = RFE(estimator, n_features_to_select=10)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)

# RFECV (automatic)
selector_cv = RFECV(estimator, cv=5)
X_selected = selector_cv.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
```

### Proper Evaluation:
```python
# Correct workflow
selector.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Fit on training only
X_train_selected = selector.transform(X_train)
X_test_selected = selector.transform(X_test)

# Train and evaluate
model.fit(X_train_selected, y_train)
test_accuracy = model.score(X_test_selected, y_test)
```

## üéì Learning Objectives

After completing this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** the difference between filter and wrapper methods
2. **Implement** various feature selection techniques
3. **Evaluate** feature selection performance properly
4. **Choose** the right method for your dataset
5. **Avoid** common pitfalls in feature selection
6. **Apply** best practices for train-test evaluation

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you get import errors:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy
```

### If the full implementation doesn't work:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### If you want to use your own dataset:
Modify the `load_data()` function in the implementation files.
