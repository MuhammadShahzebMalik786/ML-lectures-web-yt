# Linear Regression - 3 Minute ML Lecture

## 📚 Overview
A complete 3-minute lecture on Linear Regression - the foundation of machine learning. Perfect for beginners who want to understand the basics quickly with practical examples.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand what linear regression is
- Learn the basic formula: y = mx + b
- See real-world applications
- Run practical code examples
- Know when to use linear regression

## 📁 Files Included
- `linear-regression-lecture.html` - Interactive 3-minute lecture with timer
- `linear_regression_demo.py` - Python examples and demonstrations
- `LINEAR_REGRESSION_README.md` - This file

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Lecture
1. Open `linear-regression-lecture.html` in your browser
2. The 3-minute timer will start automatically
3. Follow along with the sections

### Run the Code Examples
```bash
python linear_regression_demo.py
```

## 📊 What You'll Learn

### 1. Basic Concept
- Linear regression finds the best straight line through data
- Formula: y = mx + b
- Used for predicting continuous values

### 2. Real Examples
- **Study Hours → Exam Scores**
- **House Size → Price**
- **Experience → Salary**

### 3. Code Implementation
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
prediction = model.predict([[new_value]])
```

## 🎓 Key Takeaways
- ✅ Simple and interpretable
- ✅ Great baseline model
- ✅ Fast training and prediction
- ❌ Only works for linear relationships
- ❌ Sensitive to outliers

## 📈 Next Steps
After mastering linear regression:
1. Try polynomial regression
2. Learn multiple linear regression
3. Explore regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
4. Study logistic regression for classification

## 🛠️ Requirements
